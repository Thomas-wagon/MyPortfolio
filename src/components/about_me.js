                    After 7 years working as an industrial designer, I wanted to renew myself and start learning web development by following the full Stack Web Development training offered by LE WAGON MONTREAL.(https://www.lewagon.com/en/montreal).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm looking forward to find a position as web developer that allows me, ideally, to combine my new skills with those I already mastered in 3D modeling and product design, to make the most of my creativity.
